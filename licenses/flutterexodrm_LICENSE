I don't know how to write License here
But Please don't try to copy it and publish as if your own (dick move)
You are free to use the project and resources
And feel free to give suggestions and Contributions so that i can finish it easily
All the credits goes to Google's Flutter and Android Team for developing the framework
NOTE
This is only a test package needed to publish it to test in my current project still waiting my pull Request to be verified
by the author,once that is done I will bring this package down and shift to main one.
