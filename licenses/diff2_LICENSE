// Javascript, Copyright (c) 2012 Tao Klerks <tao@klerks.biz>
// 
// This ported code is NOT cleaned up in terms of style, nor tested/optimized for 
//  performance, nor even tested for correctness across all methods - it is an 
//  extremely simplistic minimal-changes conversion/porting. The plan is to clean 
//  it up to be more pleasant to look at an deal with at a later time.
//  To anyone who is familiar with and understands the original terminology of 
//  diff and diff3 concepts, I apologize for my fanciful naming strategy - I has 
//  to come up with object names and haven't yet had a chance to review the 
//  literature.
// Also added a "diff_merge_keepall()" implementation for simplistic 2-way merge.
