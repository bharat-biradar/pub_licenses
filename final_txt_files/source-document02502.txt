2006-44 Dear Daisy Dog Our neighborLs Jack Russell terrorizes our community. He has bitten at least 10 people, including my child. In addition, he invades our yard and attacks our dog.
We like our neighbor, but we canCit get the message across that her dog should not run loose. What can we do? Daisy Responds I wouldnCit want to live with a biting dog, but if your neighbor
chooses to, the least she can do is protect others from her canine terrorist. If talking hasnCIt resolved the problem, photocopy this column and send it to her. Attach a petition signed by others
in your neighborhood. If that doesnCit work, contact the authorities. I live in Pennsylvania, and under our Dog Law, any dog that attacks a human without provocation 1 even once 0 can be
declared a dangerous dog. When this occurs, the owner must confine the dog and post a warning, complete with a symbol recognized by children. When the dog is off his property, he must be
leashed and muzzled. In addition, the dogs owner must pay 2 $200 registration fee and carry a $50,000 insurance policy. Dogs that bite give all of us a bad name. For our sake 0) and to
protect a child who might suffer permanent nerve damage or facial scars from the next bite CI please get this dog off the streets.
