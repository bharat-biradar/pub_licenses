Toilet Humor This next little nugget I lifted directly from . ItLIs an oldie but a goodie. The Onion You And Me And Baby Minus Me Makes Two ItLs hard to believe that soon there are going to
be two people in our little brood. Nothing brings two people closer together quite like one of them being a mother and the other a child. No, thereCIs nothing in the world more special than
that. You and I are going to have so many good times together until you start to show! And after that, you and the baby will have so many good times together, too. Of course, IDIII be having
great times on my own. I know that might be hard to believe right now, but dont worryDitOs true. IDII be having an absolute blast. Just think of the happy, loving family weCIll make: You
and the baby, plus me 700 miles away. ThatCIs the kind of family IClve always wanted, and youClve made it possible. ItCis truly a dream come true. A woman plus her child minus a man there
to provide support; now thatCls what I call the perfect couple. And letUls face it: The whole idea of couplehood is kind of ruined by a third person, isnDIt it? But I wouldnCit want you to be the
one who has to give up all that beautiful couple stuff. So ICIII do the responsible thing and bow out. IDIII be a man about it. Do you think youd even want me around? I know I wouldnCit. It
just wouldnCit be right. A pair of little feet running around the house. ThatCls exactly what you need! And I need my own pair of feet to run out of the house as quickly as possible. I canCit
believe how wonderful this is going to be for at least one of the three of us. Oh, wow, this is such a magical time! YouCIre really, really going to have a baby! And ICIm not! Not in the physical
sense, of course, and not in the couplesC] ubiquitous we sense, either. IDIm just plain not going to be there at all, and I canCit tell you how great that makes me feel. Watching our childOs,
birth, seeing it grow, hearing its first word and seeing its first stepO11Dm going to burst with joy over not seeing a single one of these things. I can hardly wait for the blessed event of me
moving far away, someplace where all this baby business is just a memory, and a short-lived one at that. You and the baby have made me the happiest man in the world. Not long ago, T
didnOit know what I was going to do with my life. But now you and the baby have given me the strength and courage to high-tail it out of town as fast as humanly possible. Thank you, from
the bottom of my heart, for making my life complete again. I love this so much
